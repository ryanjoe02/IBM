## What is Data Science
  * The 5 V's of big data
    - Volumn
    > The first of the 5 V's of big data, refers to the amount of data that exists. (Base of big data)
    - Velocity
    > How quickly data is generated and how quickly that data moves. Data could flow from sources such as machines, networks, smartphones or social media. The data needs to be digested and analyzed quickly, and sometimes in near real time. 
    - Variety
    > It refers to the diversity of data types. The challenge in variety concerns the standardization and distribution of all data being collected.
    Collected data can be unstructured, semi-structured or structured in nature. 
    - Veracity
    > It refers to the quality and accuracy of data. Gathered data could have missing pieces, may be inaccurate or may not be able to provide real, valuable insight.
    - Value
    > It refers to the value that big data can provide, and it relates directly to what organizations can do with that collected data. 
  * Big Data
    > it is a combination of unstructured, semi-structured or structured data collected by organization.
  * Regression Analysis
    > It is a form of predictive modelling technique which investigates the relationship between a dependent (target) and independent variables (predictor).
