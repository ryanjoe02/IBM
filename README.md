## What is Data Science
  * The 5 V's of big data
    1. Volumn
     - The first of the 5 V's of big data, refers to the amount of data that exists. Base of big data
    2. Velocity
      - How quickly data is generated and how quickly that data moves.
      - Data could flow from sources such as machines, networks, smartphones or social media. 
      - The data needs to be digested and analyzed quickly, and sometimes in near real time. 
    3. Variety
     - It refers to the diversity of data types. 
     - The challenge in variety concerns the standardization and distribution of all data being collected.
    Collected data can be unstructured, semi-structured or structured in nature. 
    4. Veracity
     - It refers to the quality and accuracy of data. 
     - Gathered data could have missing pieces, may be inaccurate or may not be able to provide real, valuable insight.
    5. Value
     - It refers to the value that big data can provide, and it relates directly to what organizations can do with that collected data. 
  * Big Data
    + it is a combination of unstructured, semi-structured or structured data collected by organization.
    
## Regression
 > [Essential regression techniques](https://www.analyticsvidhya.com/blog/2015/08/comprehensive-guide-regression/)
 ### Regression analysis
  + It is a form of predictive modelling technique which investigates the relationship between a `dependent (target)` and `independent variables (predictor)`. 
  + Regression analysis estimates the relationship between two or more variables.
    > We can predict future sales of the company based on current & past information (economic conditions).
 ### Linear Regression
  + It is one of the most widely known modeling technique.
  + In this technique, the `dependent variable (Y)` is continuous, `independent variables (X)` can be continuous or discrete, and `nature of regression` line is linear.
  ```
  Equation : Y = a + b*X + e
  a = intercept
  b = slope of line
  e = error term
  ```

  + Difference between linear and multiple linear regression
   ```
   multiple linear regression has (>1)
   linear regression has only 1 independent variable
   ```
